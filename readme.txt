Over the years, at most organizations that incoming flood of data has settled into a collection of many small but separate ponds.
That’s not surprising, since most companies are comprised of a number of distinct business units. So there’s been a natural tendency to distribute data across all business units, each having its own little pond of data.Additionally,Organizations using conventional API integration methods to bring large files can struggle in bringing the data from different sources and different types.
There is a solution that provides the opportunity to store essentially unlimited quantities of data in a scalable fashion. It’s a solution that also accommodates the wide range of data types that are flooding into every company in the age of Big Data. It’s even a very cost effective solution.
But how do you merge all those little ponds of data, whether a few or hundreds, into a single data lake that serves as a single repository for the entire organization?
Ans: Using our Data ingestion tool. We provide the tool to integrate the data from multiple sources / nodes and store into a single repository. The tool can be extended to work with multiple structures data sources and types.Teams can do this in non-technical ways without heavy coding and additional infrastructure. It provides a time effective way for the prcess to carry out.
